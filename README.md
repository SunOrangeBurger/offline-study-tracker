# Study Tracker App

## Overview
This app was basically created because i genuinely couldn't find the motivation to study, so I decided to gamify the experience. It requires a bit of elbow grease to setup but i feel like a native windows app over a desktop variant does wonders for a lot of syllabus trackabaility(since i dont have to setup an online extra database){clearly mongoDB Atlas has given me a lot of headache}

## Features
A lot of features, a theme switch(i prefer using dark), JSON adoption, Dynamic Tracking, SQLite database, works offline, small installer and package, no electron, sick UI

## Setup
Both the installers(the msi and nsis will be put up on the github), its not a virus(more or less) and is very quick for installation. Just download any installer and run it(I use the MSI version cus idk it works more or less)

## Final Thoughts
This is my first proper documentation of a project, I would dive more into the technical aspect of it all, but right now this will suffice for most users, codebase is open source as always :)
